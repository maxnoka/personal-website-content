--- Intro
<p>A responsive personal website written (at the moment) in vanilla PHP. 
Includes a database-less content management system for serving a blog and showcasing personal projects.</p>
--- Detailed
<p>The point of this project was to allow me to host my own website on the <a href="https://www.srcf.net/">Cambridge University
 Student-Run Computing Facility</a>. I tried to make it as simple and bare-bones as possible, while still having a reasonable feature set that
 makes managing content easy.</p>

<p> For what I wanted to do (displaying a couple of blog post and project descriptions), I didn't see the need for a database, so content
 is managed through a couple of text files in a git submodule.</p>
