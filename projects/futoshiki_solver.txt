--- Intro
<p>My first (real) C++ Project! A C++ program for solving Futoshiki puzzles, with a PHP (+ minor bit of JS) API and web-interface.</p>
--- Detailed
<p>Futoshiki is one of those types of puzzles which (like Sodoku) often appears in the puzzle sections of newspapers.
 The aim of the game is to fill out a grid of positive integers which satisfy a set of constraints.
 Like in Sodoku, only one of each number can appear in each row or column, but additionally inequality constraints can be specified between neighbouring squares.<p>

<p>This project includes a C++ program in which I have tried to abstract the Futoshiki puzzle into a general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem"> Constraint
Satisfaction Problem</a>. The program uses the available constraints to narrow down the set of valid options for each cell in the puzzle.
 If it gets stuck it can guess a valid cell value and recurse through the tree of different solutions until it finds a valid solution.
 This way the program can determine if there exists a valid solution with the given constraints, and if so is guaranteed to find one.
 Currently it does not check the uniqueness of the solution.</p>

<p>There is also a PHP based web REST API, through which the program can be accessed. It checks the validity of the posted input and calls the solver executable through the command line.
 Finally, I've also made a little web interface with which a Futoshiki puzzle can be constructed and submitted to the solver.</p>

<p> A further extension I would like to do is for the program to be able to create Futoshiki puzzles which have a unique solution.</p>
